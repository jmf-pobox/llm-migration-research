## File Dependencies

```
No dependencies between files - each can be read independently.

However, recommended reading order:
1. INDEX.md (navigation)
2. README.md (quick start) or EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md (overview)
3. io_contract.md (specification)
4. DETAILED_TEST_RESULTS.md (validation)
5. test_data.csv (test generation)
```

## Integration Points

### With Java Implementation
- Use test_data.csv for automated testing
- Reference io_contract.md for behavior specification
- Check DETAILED_TEST_RESULTS.md for validation

### With CI/CD Pipeline
- Consume test_data.csv format
- Validate against expected outputs
- Report against test categories

### With Documentation
- Use README.md for user-facing docs
- Reference EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md for methodology
- Include test cases from test_data.csv in docs

## Version Control

**Specification Version:** 1.0
**Python Implementation Version:** Current at 2025-12-28
**Contract Type:** I/O behavior specification
**Target Implementation:** Java

Not versioned separately - this contract represents the Python implementation state at generation date.

## Success Criteria

Java implementation is considered successful when:

1. Exact Output Match
   - All 18 successful test cases produce identical output
   - Byte-for-byte comparison with io_contract.md

2. Error Handling
   - All 3 error cases produce identical error messages
   - Error format matches Python implementation

3. System Integration
   - Exit code 0 on success
   - Exit code 1 on error
   - Error messages to stderr

4. Validation
   - 21/21 test cases pass
   - All checks in DETAILED_TEST_RESULTS.md verified
   - No deviations from specification

## Support & Reference

For behavioral specification: See io_contract.md
For methodology: See EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md
For quick reference: See README.md
For test data: See test_data.csv
For navigation: See INDEX.md

## Final Notes

This I/O contract represents a complete capture of the Python rpn2tex implementation's behavior. It was generated by executing the actual implementation on representative test cases and documenting the exact outputs.

The contract is ready for:
- Java implementation development
- Automated test suite creation
- Behavioral validation
- Regression testing
- Documentation reference
